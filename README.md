# Feedback Management System

## Description

The Feedback Management System is a comprehensive tool designed to efficiently track and manage student records while assessing faculty performance based on feedback provided by students. This system was developed using cutting-edge technologies and frameworks to ensure its effectiveness and user-friendliness.

### Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: We utilized the Spring Boot framework as the core application framework, providing a robust and scalable backend.

- **Lombok Library**: Lombok was used to streamline backend development, making the code more concise and readable.

- **Hibernate ORM**: Hibernate played a crucial role in managing the connection between our application and the database, ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval.

- **React, HTML, and CSS**: These frontend technologies were employed to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface for both students and faculty members.

- **IntelliJ (Backend) and Visual Studio Code (Frontend)**: These development platforms were chosen to maximize productivity and code quality in both backend and frontend development.

- **Postman**: For testing purposes, Postman was used to make API calls and verify the storage of data in the backend.

### User Roles

- **Faculty (Admin)**: Faculty members have administrative privileges, allowing them to add, create, and update data. They can also view the overall performance of courses.

- **Student**: Students are provided with unique usernames and passwords by the organization. After logging in, they can give feedback for various courses and view their own feedback status.

### Functionality

#### For Students:

- Upon successful login, students are directed to the feedback page, where they can choose a course and provide their feedback.

- If a student has already submitted feedback for a particular course, they will receive a notification indicating that they can only view their feedback status.

#### For Faculty (Admins):

- Faculty members can log in and access the feedback status page, which provides an overview of course performance categorized as poor, good, average, or excellent.

- Faculty members have the capability to create surveys. When creating a survey, they must provide course name, branch name, start date, end date, and questions to be included in the survey.

### Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient and user-friendly Student Feedback Report System. This system enables:

- Systematic collection of feedback data from students.

- In-depth analysis of feedback data.

- Generation of insightful reports based on the collected data.

### How to Run

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Set up the backend using IntelliJ and the frontend using Visual Studio Code.

3. Configure the database connection details in the backend application.

4. Install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

5. Run the Spring Boot application for the backend and the React application for the frontend.

6. Access the system by opening a web browser and navigating to the appropriate URL.

Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or enhancements.

# Feedback Management System

## Overview

The **Feedback Management System** is a sophisticated and intuitive tool engineered to efficiently monitor and manage student records while assessing faculty performance based on comprehensive feedback provided by students. This project leverages cutting-edge technologies and frameworks to deliver a powerful and user-friendly solution.

## Technologies Utilized

- **Spring Boot**: As the cornerstone of our application, Spring Boot offers a robust and scalable backend framework.

- **Lombok Library**: Lombok was employed to enhance backend development, leading to cleaner and more concise code.

- **Hibernate ORM**: Hibernate serves as the linchpin connecting our application seamlessly with the database, ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval.

- **Frontend Technologies**: To deliver an exceptional user experience, we harnessed the capabilities of React, HTML, and CSS for the frontend.

- **Development Environments**: We chose IntelliJ for the backend and Visual Studio Code for the frontend, enabling us to maximize productivity and maintain code quality.

- **Testing with Postman**: Postman was employed for rigorous testing, allowing us to make API calls and validate data storage in the backend.

## Other Development Software
- **Operating System**: Windows 11 provides a stable and familiar environment for development.

- **Documentation**: MS Office and Google Docs are employed for generating reports and other essential documents.

- **Diagrams**: Lucidchart and erdplus are utilized for creating diagrams to enhance system understanding.

- **Server Stack**: XAMPP server, a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package, is deployed. It consists primarily of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database and interpreters for Java programming languages.

## User Roles

### Faculty (Admin)

- Faculty members possess administrative privileges, enabling them to add, create, and update data. They also have access to comprehensive insights into course performance.

### Student

- Students are granted unique usernames and passwords by the organization. After successful login, they can provide feedback for various courses and view their personal feedback status.

## Key Features

### For Students:

- Upon login, students are directed to the feedback page where they can select a course and submit their feedback.

- If a student has previously submitted feedback for a particular course, they will receive a notification, allowing them to view their feedback status.

### For Faculty (Admins):

- Faculty members have access to the feedback status page, providing an overview of course performance categorized as poor, good, average, or excellent.

- Faculty members can create surveys, requiring course name, branch name, start date, end date, and questions for inclusion.

## Project Objectives

The primary project objectives are as follows:

1. **Efficiency**: Develop an efficient system for systematic data collection and analysis of student feedback.

2. **User-Friendly**: Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both students and faculty members.

3. **Insightful Reports**: Generate insightful reports based on the collected feedback data to assess faculty performance.

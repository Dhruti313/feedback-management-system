# feedback-management-system
**Description**
We have developed feedback generation report system. 
In this project our aim was to create an efficient system for tracking and managing students record and show overall faculty performance on the basis of feedback given by student.
for getting data, we collected feedback from student for different courses. we used spring boot which is popular framework to build core application and lombok library was used for backend.
This collected feedback as stored in database for further analysis and creating report.
we worked on hibernate ORM which helped us to manage connection between our application and database.
For making UI user friendly we used react , HTML and CSS. 
platform used for backend was intelliJ and frontend  visual studio code.
for testing we used postman so that we can make api calls to check wheter data is stored in backend or not
This application is use by both student and faculty. here faculty is admin so faculty can add data, create data , update data and also faculty can view overall performance of courses.
and student can give feedback and view there own feedback.
students and faculty are provided by username and password by organization.
If student logins is validated he will redirect to feedback page where he can choose course name and give his feedback. or if student has already given he may get notification of feedback already submitted and he can only view his feedback status.
If faculty login is validated he gets feedback status page where faculty can view overall status of course which is in form of poor, good, average or excellent. and if he wants to add questions for student he can visit to create survey. In create survey faculty must provide course name , branch name , start date, end date and faculty may add questions..
so overall objective of this project is to develop efficient and user friendly student feedback report system that enables systematic collection ,analysis and generate report from the data collected from student.
